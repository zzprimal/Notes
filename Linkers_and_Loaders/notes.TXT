Chapter 2:
.Segments can be thought as pages except usually much longer and organized so that the data inside each segment is relevant to eachother, segments are stored via segment numbers
via specific registers and the virtual addresses for these segments can be got via 2 methods, in real mode where we shift the segment numbers by 4 bits to the left to get the 
virtual address and by protected mode which is just a virtual memory system which maps segment numbers to arbitary virtual addresses and also provides protection bits to each
segment
