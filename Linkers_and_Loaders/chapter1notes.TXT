Linking is the process of combining object files to create other object files, linking really does these main things, one is relocation which is the process of taking
data and code from the object files and organizing them and giving them new load addresses, next is symbol resolution which is giving references to symbols the new proper
pointers to the actual symbols location (symbols are named objects in the source code that the programmer defined, can be functions to variables and even more).
