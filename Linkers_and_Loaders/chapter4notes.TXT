80% of the storage in a program is allocated by the linker combining the load segments of object files that are used for input, bellow are some cases of the other 20% of the
remaining storage for programs

IBM pseudo registers:
pseudo registers are storage that sections of a program can share with other sections, this area of data is not created by the linker, but instead the linker just calculates
the concatenated size of all pseudo register and then startup code on program execution dynamically allocates this space (in _init function or something similar), pseudo 
registers are a case of program storage where the linker does not allocate it and instead calculates the size of it and lets startup code created by compilers (?) dynamically
allocate this space using the size the linker generated.
