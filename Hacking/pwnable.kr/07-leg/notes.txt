0x00008ce4 + 0x00008d0c + 0x00008d80

key1 = 0x00008ce4 // correct
key2 = 0x00008d0c // correct
key3 = 0x00008d80 // correct

key1 is 0x00008ce4 since pc is stored inside of r0 which is return register and since pc is current instruction + 8 we get 0x00008ce4
key2 is 0x00008d0c since we mov pc to r3 and since we are in thumb mode pc is not current instruction + 8 so we get 0x00008d08, we later add 4 to this so
we end up with 0x00008d0c, we then move this to r0 our return value so we have final value 0x00008d0c (there are some instructions inbetween this mov and
the operation instructions on r3, but apparently these are obsolete, we switch to thumb node at instruction "bx r6" since r6 has least significant bit 1)
key3 is 0x00008d80 since this is the next instruction after the return to main and we mov the link register (lr) to return register r0

value is 108400 and key is "My daddy has a lot of ARMv5te muscle!"
