solved by analyzing the heap towards the end of the program at the exit_group syscall, can get there easily by using the catch syscall command in gdb-pwndbg and going through all of the syscalls before it, using strace and turning off aslr you can see the exact places where the heap starts and where the program break for the heap ends before termination of the program (turning off aslr enables the address of the heap to be constant so this will stay the same throughout all runs), then using the "x/<num>x <address>" command where num is the number of bytes you want to leak and address is a heap address you can leak heap memory and you just have to scan through it till you find a string that is readable that looks like it can be the solution, in my case the heap started at 0x6c7000 and ended at 0x6e91c0 and i found the solution at 0x6e91c0 which contained the string "UPX...? sounds like a delivery service :)" and that was the solution (note it is very important to turn off aslr to make your life easier though it is possible without)
