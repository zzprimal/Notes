we are given an executable that allows us to execute any command except it cant contain the strings flag, sh, and tmp which prevents us from refering to the flag for a cat,
prevents us from calling an interactive shell to cat from there, and creating a temporary directory to do any symbolic link shenanigans or script shenanigans to get the flag,
instead we can just use variables since it seems bash parses the input lines and replaces all instances of $<var> with the variables value (atleast bash seems to do this) so we
can just export a new environment variable "export a=flag" then call cmd1 like follows "./cmd1 '/bin/cat $a'" where we have to specify the full path for cat since PATH is edited
in the source code of cmd1, doing this we get the flag "mommy now I get what PATH environment is for :)" (didnt really teach me anything new about PATH so i have no idea
what this was for, kinda like the passcode ctf in this sense)
