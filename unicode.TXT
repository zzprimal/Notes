unicode is a character encoding for characters on machines, there are smaller character encoding protocals and there are bigger character encoding protocals with the smaller
ones being a subset of the bigger ones, for example ascii is a character encoding that is a subset of utf-8 which is a subset of utf-16, on windows you can type these character
via the number pad and holding alt then pressing plus and typing the decimal value of the character encoding and making sure to zero extend this value to 4 digits
