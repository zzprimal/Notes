. .git/HEAD contains a ref (a reference to a commit) which points to .git/refs/heads/<branch name> which is a file that contains the id of the current commit snapshot you are
working with (note head in this case means a referance to a named branch)

. .git/logs/HEAD contains details of your commit history with the commit ids and the commit messages (.git/logs/refs/heads/main contains the exact same information aswell)

. a remote is just a binding of a cloud repository to a variable name, ex "git remote add origin https://github.com/zzprimal/myssh.git" binds origin to the url that specifies
a cloud repository


git fetch:
updates your local repository with the commits of a remote repository and all the unrecorded history of commits in said remote repository (to use these repositories to 
update your working directory you have to do a merge or a rebase to combine the 2 possible splitting branches)

github actions workflow:
a workflow defines a series of jobs to be performed once a certain action is taken (for example doing a push or pull to a branch), if a job fails then the workflow fails
and the developer will be notified as such, this is useful for autamating testing for example so on every new commit to main you can have a default set of tests that every
commit must pass for it to be allowed to be pushed to main, a github actions workflow is defined in a .yaml file which states what event triggers the workflow and what jobs
to perform once that event has occured (note a github actions workflow is different from a git workflow which states the commit and branch strategy for a group of developers
working together on a project)
