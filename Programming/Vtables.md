# Vtables
Vtables are data structures, more specifically 1 dimensional arrays associated with each class, with each element of the array specifying a method of the class, the methods each vtable points to are also consistent between siblings so that polymorphism works, so a method for a base and derived class will be at the exact same index for their respective vtables, so a derived classes vtable can be thought of as a superset of a base classes vtable in regards to the methods inside the vtable (except the set has an order). When an object is created a hidden member is put into that object which is a pointer to the class which that object instantiates vtable, this is then used to call every method for the object, and if polymorphism is used and the object is casted to a base class the derived classes methods are still used since the derived classes vtable is associated with the object and no errors can occur since the derived class's vtable is a superset of the base class's vtable. If a class inherrits from multiple base classes the classes members will be set up in sections, each section having all the members for the base class and a vtable version for that specific base class (so a class can have multiple vtables, each for one of it's base classes), once an upcast occurs on the derived class all that is done is the pointer the derived class object members is incremented to point to where the base classes members are in that derived class object so it will look identical to an instantiated version of the base class. For any method that isn't virtual though it is just called directly since no polymorphism can occur.
