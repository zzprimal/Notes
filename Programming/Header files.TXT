Header files in C and other C languages are not really a necessary existence, they are just a way to help organize code and make everything look and feel nicer, these notes
will go over the uses of header files and will help me organize my thoughts about them

.Header files are very useful when creating shared libraries that will be used by multiple programs, so when a certain program needs to use functions from this shared library
all thats necessary to declare them is using that shared library's respective header file, the header file can also be used for type definition that are used in the shared
library and storing all the shared library header inclusions and acting as documentation for the functions in said library which is especially useful if the source code in
the shared library is encapsulated

.Related to above point but creating a header file for a source file allows portability of the code in the source file

.Can be used when multiple source files are sharing certain data type definitions, global variables, and also maybe function prototypes if you want to really reach
