.An overlay network is a virtual network that uses physical networks to travel from one point to another, so an overlay network directly connects one host to another host using
virtual links but in reality what is actually connecting these 2 hosts together are physical networks that use physical links and protocals at lower layers

.A layer 2 network is a overlay network since it uses the underlying layer 1 infustructer to send its frames and relys on this infustructer, and the same can be said for layer
3 networks for example where instead the underlying network would be layer 2 and layer 1 and this can be extended to layer i networks where i is an integer for a layer

. The fabric is all the physical infustructer necessary for a virtual network to be able to function
