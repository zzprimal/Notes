Linux handles random number generators by first keeping track and updating an entropy pool which is just a pool of random data created by combining a bunch of seemingly random events that happen on your computer, things like interrupts, key presses maybe, and much more. Then that data is put through the BLACK2 hash function and given as input to the ChaCha20 stream cipher which generates our random bytes. Some interfaces for the driver responsible for this are /dev/random and /dev/urandom for example.
