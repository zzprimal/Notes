is the point where your computer interacts with the network it currently resides in, this term refers to the hardware side (network interface card, ethernet port, etc) and also
the software side (stuff like reverting the layers of a packet that is recieved from the hardware side for example and sending to the right application)

according to IBM a network interface is software that interacts with network device drivers and the internet layer and acts as an in between point for the 2 and adds layers
and removes layers when giving a datagram (to the drivers) or a frame (to the internet layer) and possibly does other things aswell

Note, this is all speculation and could be wrong
